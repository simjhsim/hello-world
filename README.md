# hello-world
This will be a repository of miscellaneous code I wrote
while trying to become comfortable with C++. 

Projects will include Project Euler code (though I will 
try to refrain from writing obvious answers), random
gadgets to make my life easier, and fun side projects.

For Project Euler, the purpose is not just to solve the
problems but also to write helper functions that can be
generalized to uses other than the specific problem.
With a few exceptions, many of the problems will solved
using functions that generalize the problem. For example,
if the problem asks for the first triangular number with
greater than 500 divisors, the function will take 500
as an input.
