# hello-world
This will be a repository of miscellaneous code I wrote
while trying to become comfortable with C++. 

Projects will include Project Euler code (though I will 
try to refrain from writing obvious answers), random
gadgets to make my life easier, and fun side projects.

For Project Euler, the purpose is not just to solve the
problems but also to write helper functions that can be
generalized to uses other than the specific problem.
